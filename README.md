# Project Overview

## What is Red2Blue?
**Red2Blue** is a hands-on home SOC lab designed to demonstrate how common attack techniques generate logs and telemetry, and how defenders can detect, investigate, and respond to these attacks using **Splunk**.

This project bridges the gap between **Red Team attack simulation** and **Blue Team detection engineering**, focusing on attacker behavior rather than tools.

## What You Will Learn
By working through this lab, you will learn how to:
- Build a complete SOC lab at home using Splunk
- Simulate realistic attack scenarios in a controlled environment
- Analyze attacker-generated telemetry
- Write effective SPL-based detections
- Think like a SOC analyst and detection engineer

## Lab Architecture
Before we dive into the technical steps, let’s quickly understand the architecture:
- Windows 10 Host (Soc analyst)
  - Runs Splunk Enterprise
  - Acts as the SIEM server
- Windows 10 Virtual Machine (Endpoint)
  - Runs Splunk Universal Forwarder
  - Generates logs (Windows Events + Sysmon)
- Communication
  - Logs are sent from the VM to the host via TCP Port (e.g., 9997)

# Infrastructure

## Infrastructure Diagram (Architecture Schema)

#### The infrastructure diagram illustrates a simple SOC lab architecture where a Windows 10 endpoint generates security telemetry using Sysmon and Windows Event Logs. This telemetry is collected and forwarded by the Splunk Universal Forwarder to a centralized Splunk Enterprise SIEM server over TCP port 9997. The SIEM server indexes, stores, and analyzes the incoming logs, enabling detection and alerting use cases.

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="ChatGPT Image Feb 4, 2026, 12_01_00 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/440b54e4-a3ba-460f-8b35-79f5a5532cdb" />

## SIEM Server (Windows 10 Host)

### Splunk Enterprise Setup & Installation
First, in our **Windows 10 (HOST)** navigate to splunk.com and create a free account if you haven’t already And download the latest version of Splunk Enterprise
([https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download.html](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download.html))

<p align="left">
  <img width="40%" alt="Screenshot_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/946943b0-35c6-453e-a38a-c1c6068afdc9" />
  <img width="40%" alt="Screenshot_2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24ef079d-6e64-4543-9550-fb4a201d4321" />
</p>

After downloading the .MSI, we are going to setup it. The process is simple, just a three click step.
1. Accept license agreement., and click next

<img alt="Screenshot_3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b74c62ee-26d8-4592-aa53-6d3f03a4e9ff" />

2. In the next step, we are going to setup the username and password that will be required to access the web GUI of Splunk

<img alt="Screenshot_4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/234a583e-8eda-4a8a-b02d-990020dfee6b" />

3. Hit the Install Button, And Finish

<p align="left">
  <img width="40%" alt="Screenshot_5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd8076a9-41a2-4e16-960a-781ed22c367b" />
  <img width="40%" alt="Screenshot_6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/879f6a6d-c608-45ec-9dee-bc5e85cffcc5" />
</p>

After The installation process Finish, Splunk GUI will open in the browser.
Here’s the SPLUNK login page and we will require the credentials that was setup during installation process:

<img width="1400" height="611" alt="Screenshot_7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/538fd714-a483-4219-9bf9-fe241cbe9653" />

At this point, Splunk Enterprise is installed but not yet configured to receive logs.

### Initial Splunk Configuration
Splunk Enterprise is managed through its web interface, called Splunk Web.
1. Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000
2. Log in using the credentials you created during installation.

<img width="1365" height="623" alt="Screenshot_8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca0dd4a1-4db2-4e6b-843a-08ddad5854e5" />

#### Configure Receiving Port
To allow log ingestion from forwarders:
1. Go to -> Settings -> Forwarding and Receiving

<img width="1363" height="615" alt="Screenshot_9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0d48916-a038-48ad-aa10-973ad4aeafe6" />

Set port 9997 as the listening port for incoming logs.

<img width="1365" height="621" alt="Screenshot_10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a17531a-d11d-456f-98df-04eebe1e213b" />
<img width="1365" height="629" alt="Screenshot_11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/975a5346-6c81-4032-9c51-f2597248ea51" />


#### Configure Indexes
In Splunk, indexes are storage locations where incoming data is organized and kept for searching and analysis. They help Splunk quickly retrieve and manage large volumes of log or event data efficiently.W
We will Configure 4 indexes
- windows_system
- windows_security
- windows_application
- sysmon
I will explain how to do it once and you can do the same for the 4 indexes
1. Go to -> Settings -> Indexes

<img width="1361" height="616" alt="Screenshot_15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56b0981b-5e4e-45f3-9a17-cd8215a8d3e5" />

2. From The Indexes window click **New Index**

<img width="1363" height="620" alt="Screenshot_16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3c5c9ea-9784-4455-a6fc-4bfe8ae1fc74" />

3. From The new Window type the index name (i.s sysmon) and keep everything in default and hit **Save**

<img width="1052" height="597" alt="Screenshot_17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6db9fae2-c3a6-462a-a424-8e8e0c0ba8f9" />

Do the same with the 3 left indexes
> [!NOTE]
> Tall now the indexes will not work until we configure it on splunk UF so do it and keep going with me

#### Configure Windows Firewall
Make sure the port is accessible:
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
Click on Inbound Rules -> New Rule -> Port and hit next

<img width="1213" height="728" alt="Screenshot_12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37eb8791-8cf9-496f-a9bf-cffa9389f9fa" />

choose TCP and The Port we sit in splunk (9997)

<img width="750" height="610" alt="Screenshot_13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5045738-53bf-4bac-97cc-170c96c4a01f" />

Next -> "Allow The Connection" -> Next -> Next -> Pick a Name Like ("Splunk Port") And Hit Finish

<img width="1025" height="349" alt="Screenshot_14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f31c9d6b-2021-4edf-a228-e61dfafa92c6" />

### Add-ons & Apps Configuration
A Splunk Add-on is a package that allows Splunk to collect, parse, and normalize data from a specific source. It extends Splunk’s capabilities without adding dashboards or visualizations.
We will use Microsoft Sysmon Add-on & Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows

lets start with **Microsoft Sysmon Add-on** To install it go to https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
Login and hit download

<img width="1344" height="619" alt="Screenshot_18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d98140d-9ff5-4b33-99f9-d0c409c7e0c5" />

You will find the .gtz file in downloads folder

<img width="882" height="124" alt="Screenshot_19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52e0e804-7923-484f-ad30-a7eb46d47b08" />

Now back to splunk GUI, From home click on Apps And Manage Apps

<img width="1356" height="622" alt="Screenshot_20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ab15148-a481-4bdc-8432-c312eebc5201" />

From Apps Window Click on **Install App From File**

<img width="1364" height="625" alt="Screenshot_21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/132781cc-8bec-41d6-b5b3-614d12294580" />

Drag And Drop the .gtz File or Just Select It and click **Upload**

<img width="1360" height="627" alt="Screenshot_22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ca28f73-be95-4420-a401-aae764654b7d" />

After That you need to restart Splunk Like That `Splunk.exe restart`

<img width="953" height="491" alt="Screenshot_23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be5ce9fd-2ebf-4641-a779-a956e71b427d" />

After Restart Back to **Apps** Window search by sysmon and you will find it like that

<img width="1359" height="483" alt="Screenshot_24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ee38f5e-f1c7-4a27-8a28-e0356b65b150" />

You can do the Same With **Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows**

## Endpoint (Windows 10 VM)

### Setting Up Windows 10 on VMware
In this section, we will not dive deeply into the Windows 10 installation process on VMware.  
To keep the article concise and focused, we will skip the step-by-step installation details.  
Instead, you can see this video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-avnck74gs.  
If you are not familiar with installing Windows 10 on VMware, this video will guide you through the process.

> [!NOTE]
> Make two network adapters one **Host-Only** and one **NAT**

Once the Windows 10 VM is installed normally and running, we will move on to the next step.

### Sysmon Installation & Configuration
Sysmon (System Monitor) is a Windows system service that provides detailed visibility into what is happening on an endpoint.  
It helps us track important activities like process creation, network connections, file creation, and registry changes.

In short, Sysmon gives us high-quality logs that are very useful for detection and analysis inside Splunk.

#### Download Sysmon
First, download Sysmon from the official Microsoft Sysinternals website on the endpoint (Win 10 VM)\
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)

<img width="1362" height="692" alt="Screenshot_25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef76c8f-a1bd-48f9-b96d-cee29f00f854" />

Copy The .ZIP File to **C** directory and extracting the files

<img width="1089" height="281" alt="Screenshot_26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ae9b15d-ecde-4b8a-b38a-b48f20a381c8" />

#### Download Sysmon Configuration (SwiftOnSecurity)
By default, Sysmon does not log much unless it is configured properly.  
To solve this, we will use the popular Sysmon configuration created by **SwiftOnSecurity**,.  
which provides a good balance between visibility and noise.

Download the configuration file and save it in the C partition ( C:\sysmon\ ) [SwiftOnSecurity](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config/blob/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml)

<img width="1363" height="624" alt="Screenshot_28" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dce296e-e9ab-4c67-8cf6-496ef301d51d" />

After That, Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**, then run the following command: `Sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml`
This command installs Sysmon and applies the configuration at the same time.

<img width="977" height="509" alt="Screenshot_27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e56a4341-6e48-46a6-9ecb-041c2606af96" />

#### Verification & Testing
To confirm that Sysmon is working correctly:
- From The previous cmd type: `calc.exe` 
- Open **Event Viewer**
- Navigate to: Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → Sysmon → Operational.  
Now check that events are being generated (such as process creation for the **calc.exe**)

<img width="1365" height="718" alt="Screenshot_29" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ed2ad6d-0aa1-406f-b4dc-c35dd648ae0f" />

Once Sysmon events are visible, we are ready to move forward and start forwarding these logs to Splunk.

### Splunk Universal Forwarder Setup & Installation

#### What is Splunk Universal Forwarder?

Splunk Universal Forwarder (UF) is a lightweight agent installed on endpoints to collect and forward logs to a Splunk instance.

It does not index or search data by itself.  
Its only job is to collect logs from the system and send them securely to the SIEM server (Splunk Enterprise).

In our lab, the Universal Forwarder will be installed on the Windows 10 VM and will forward to the Splunk Enterprise running on the host machine:
- Windows Event Logs
- Sysmon logs

#### Download Splunk Universal Forwarder

Download the Splunk Universal Forwarder from the official Splunk website. (https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/universal-forwarder.html)

<img width="956" height="459" alt="Screenshot_30" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e85a59db-c670-45f1-adc2-79f03148238e" />

Once downloaded, move the installer to the Windows 10 VM.

<img width="1365" height="735" alt="Screenshot_31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf0be003-b72d-47f7-8d34-9d2177eedc50" />

#### Setup & Installation
Run the Universal Forwarder installer as a Administrator.

- Accept the license agreement

<img width="515" height="397" alt="Screenshot_32" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01d36488-097e-49b7-a3f9-1da5f723246c" />

- As we aren’t using any SSL certificate, so we will skip that:
> Since this lab does not use SSL certificates, we can safely skip this step to keep the setup simple.

<img width="530" height="409" alt="Screenshot_33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1c68d9a-8d12-4958-adac-0adbd65d05c0" />

- Choose **Local System** as the service account
> Using the Local System account allows the Universal Forwarder to access Windows Event Logs and other system-level resources without additional configuration.

<img width="549" height="424" alt="Screenshot_34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c60032b-de72-4905-aa9d-0961b402400c" />

- Select what you need to be send to splunk EP
> At this stage, you choose which logs and data sources will be forwarded from the endpoint to the SIEM server.
> This typically includes Windows Event Logs, and Sysmon logs will be configured in more detail later.

<img width="534" height="414" alt="Screenshot_35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/359ef20e-fcaf-4882-beb0-2519a7d23bee" />

- Create a username & password and note it down
> m4 m7taga 4ar7 yasta

<img width="552" height="417" alt="Screenshot_36" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c83b0310-36e5-4c7d-90e0-cb3ffd112f44" />

- Enter the IP address of your Splunk Enterprise server (Windows 10 Host)
> This allows the Universal Forwarder to know where to send the collected logs.

<p align="left">
  <img width="40%" height="401" alt="Screenshot_37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d0b0553-1643-491d-9402-460d886ca8e2" />
  <img width="40%" height="401" alt="Screenshot_38" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72a1e8c2-7ca4-4d61-9fef-5bbba6893703" />
</p>

- Hit Next it will take around 2 to 3 minutes to finish the installation.

<img width="548" height="428" alt="Screenshot_39" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f66a8f1-b0f8-4d2e-a5bd-05fd56f29e41" />

After the installation is completed, the Universal Forwarder service should start automatically.  
Try This: `sc query SplunkForwarder` You should see STATE: 4 RUNNING. Like That

<img width="1024" height="567" alt="Screenshot_40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b95de11-af65-4b69-9bcc-c5953f83764c" />

Here’s the host name of my machine, that will be used in next steps in the confirmation of successful log ingestion:

<img width="1365" height="594" alt="Screenshot_41" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c419c59-d24c-4d5c-a794-a8e013232904" />

Now, we will verify that logs receiving in the SPLUNK or not. Go to the **Search** tab:

<img width="1363" height="621" alt="Screenshot_42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dde9a611-bc6c-4717-9f6a-0996f4a03ae7" />

Upon clicking the “Data Summary” button, a new pop-up window will appear and we will be able to see our Windows machine hostname, as well as the source types/log types that we selected during the installation process:

<img width="795" height="286" alt="Screenshot_43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/058fad44-a669-4944-b85a-13a32f18f1ee" />

Okay Lets Go through the Configuration part

### Splunk Universal Forwarder Configuration

At this stage, we define exactly which logs we want to collect from the endpoint and forward to Splunk Enterprise.

| File Path                                             | Purpose                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `etc\apps\SplunkUniversalForwarder\local\inputs.conf` | Controls **how logs are collected from Windows**                      |
| `etc\system\local\inputs.conf`                        | Controls **where logs are stored and how they are labeled in Splunk** |


#### Configuration C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\local\inputs.conf
Navigate to the following directory on the Windows 10 VM: `C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\local`.  
If the `inputs.conf` file does not exist, create it manually.

This configuration specifies:
- The hostname that appears inside Splunk
- Which Windows logs to collect
- Which index each log type is sent to
- Which sourcetype is applied

<img width="1207" height="626" alt="Screenshot_44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecec8547-9327-4428-b58b-6172143c75dd" />

After Creating the File set this Configuration
```ini
[default]
host = Endpoint-1

[WinEventLog://Security]
disabled = false
index = windows_security

[WinEventLog://System]
disabled = false
index = windows_system

[WinEventLog://Application]
disabled = false
index = windows_application

[WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational]
disabled = false
index = sysmon
sourcetype = XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
```

<img width="1154" height="548" alt="Screenshot_45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b01f542e-8b11-4033-8382-2d9c7d3c1da3" />


#### Configuration C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\apps\SplunkUniversalForwarder\local\inputs.conf
Navigate to the following directory on the Windows 10 VM: `C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\apps\SplunkUniversalForwarder\local\`.  
If the `inputs.conf` file does not exist, create it manually.

This configuration specifies:
- How logs are read from Windows
- From which point logs are collected
- Collection behavior (checkpoint, history, real-time)
  
<img width="1176" height="630" alt="Screenshot_47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2902ba7d-b0d7-4125-b3fe-efbe3322d5b1" />

set this Configuration

```ini
[WinEventLog://Application]
checkpointInterval = 5
current_only = 0
disabled = 0
start_from = oldest

[WinEventLog://Security]
checkpointInterval = 5
current_only = 0
disabled = 0
start_from = oldest

[WinEventLog://System]
checkpointInterval = 5
current_only = 0
disabled = 0
start_from = oldest

[WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational]
checkpointInterval = 5
current_only = 0
disabled = 0
start_from = oldest
```

<img width="1193" height="587" alt="Screenshot_48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d98b5151-cd3d-4fbb-aaa7-870095c6beb8" />


After saving the files, restart the Splunk Universal Forwarder service to apply the changes\
Once restarted, the endpoint will begin sending logs to Splunk Enterprise based on this configuration.

## Testing & Log Verification
Now let's validate that logs are being correctly generated, forwarded, and indexed in Splunk
1. Make sure the Splunk Universal Forwarder service is running -> `sc query splunkforwarder`

2. To confirm log collection, generate some test events on the endpoint:

3. Back to splunk and in search box type `index=* host="Endpoint-1"`.  
U will see that sysmon log source gen 3 logs:
  - 1 Dns Query
  - 2 Process Create

# Attack Scenarios
In this section, we will start building realistic attack scenarios to better understand how attacks happen in real environments.  
The main goal is not exploitation itself, but learning how attackers think and operate, even at a basic level.  

By simulating these scenarios, we will generate real logs and events inside our environment.  
These logs will help us understand how attacks look from a defensive POV, how they appear in the SIEM, and how we can detect, investigate, and confirm if such activity happened in our environment.  

Each attack scenario will later be mapped to MITRE ATT&CK and used to build detection use cases and alerts.  

## Attack Scenario: Phishing via Malicious Word Attachment

### Scenario Overview
This scenario focuses on one of the most common and effective initial access techniques: phishing with a malicious attachment.  

The attack starts with a phishing email that contains a malicious Microsoft Word document.  
Once the user downloads and opens the document, a macro is executed, which triggers a chain of actions leading to malware execution and command-and-control communication.

### Attack Flow
1. Attacker sends a phishing email with a malicious Word attachment
2. User downloads and opens the Word file
3. Malicious macro runs inside the document
4. Macro executes a PowerShell command
5. PowerShell downloads and executes a malicious executable
6. The malware performs discovery, persistence, and C2 communication

### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

#### Initial Access
- Phishing: Attachment (T1566.001)
#### Execution
- User Execution: Malicious File (T1204.002)
- Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell (T1059.001)
#### Command and Control
- Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)
- Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols (T1071.001)
- Beaconing (T1071.004)
#### Discovery
- System Information Discovery (T1082)
- Account Discovery (T1087)
#### Persistence
- Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys (T1547.001)
